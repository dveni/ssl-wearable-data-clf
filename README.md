# Act.App - AI powered app for Healthcare
## [CERN Webfest Hackathon project](thttps://webfest.cern/)

An AI-powered application to monitor and analyze wearable and smartphone sensor data using self-supervised algorithms to evaluate and enhance the activity level of a person in a personalized manner.

In particular, the project is divided into two parts: the first part, a Proof of Concept of the application that through gamification and education guides the users to improve their well-being and healthcare. The second part is the improvement of the existing algorithms for human activity recognition using Self-supervise learning methods.

## Technologies used

- Tool for the app: Proto.io
- Plots on the app: Python and Matplotlib
- Tools for algorithm development: Python, Github and Google Colab
